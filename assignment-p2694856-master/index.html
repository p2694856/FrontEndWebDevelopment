        <h4>My Inspiration</h4>
        <p>I decided to make a website around music
          as it includes one of my passions,
          and it really does insipire me through my day to day.
          The website mostly consist of artist that inspire me,
          but mostly does revolve around Rap and it history
          as that is the music I was brought up with. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="info">
        <h4>The Website</h4>
        <p>There are 3 Pages Other than this one
          There is an interactive Game page with 1 Game,
          2nd one yet to be implemented,
          but click the little character
          at the bottom for an easter egg
          Then there is History page, which gives insight
          on the history of rap and it's culture
          and a page where you can search
          for your favourite artist's songs
