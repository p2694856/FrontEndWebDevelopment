## index.html

Basic Introdution for the website and what went through my reasoning and choices with a couple of links for future reference
Menu was made in this page first

## history.html
This Page is just used to show the use of grid and flip boxes showcasing the life of different rappers through the use of the flip boxes and sizing
## css/styles.css

Stylesheet for both history and index and it contains everything i used to implemnt them from phone section to tablet it also contains most of the grid and flex commands of my whole website I also made the flipboxes by having nested classes on the index to give me better control, I also made the menu.

## js/scripts.js

Just Contains the basic menu as more functionality is to be found on the other pages also for both Index and History



## catalogue.html
A basic search bar which can take in an input and a mainwhich is used to display the API(try 3-4 times with the word Drake)
## css/catalogue.css
Similar to the normal css but because it uses main in a different way i thought it would be more practical to have it in a different page, the main poits are how the main is set to have a different columns for different sizes for example phones have 1 and computers have 2
## js/catalogue.js
Here i implemnted the API where it takes in the input of an artist name and shows their songs the API it self works for now with just Drake and Maroon 5 but i thought i should implemnt it as it shows the different functionalities the Api does take a three or four tries to start working but this was the best i could do and the search button must be pressed for it to start.
## games.html
This contains the html with buttons for phones and tablets, canvas to display the different games and a pixalated image at the button that makes a certain noise when pressed.
## css/games.css
In this section i have made for the back ground and i added a gif to make it more game like if the game pictures do work it should have a game vibe different from the rest of the modes and it also contains the designs for the different buttons.
## js/games.js
The Games Java script shows how i was able to implement a game into the page by having a canvas, it also shows how i could implemnt another game if i wanted to but due to time constrint i thought it was not as relevant to implemnt another game. Although I did not full developed the game i made a random noise maker that makes an artists adlib (frequent noises used throughtout a song). and it started by implemnting the button with the little pixelated character as a footer in the screen. I also made buttons for the game so it would be useable for both phones and tablet and they go invisible when at a desktop size. and I added a score to the game which wasn't available in the previous template. the template used refernced below
